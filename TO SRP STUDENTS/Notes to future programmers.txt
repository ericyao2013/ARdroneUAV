This GIT repo contains all the work done on the ar.drone and ar.drone 2.0. 
Please refer to the weekly journal on github and my final report in this folder for details.

A few notes:

- The "Scripts" folder contains scripts used to automate the process of uploading files to the drone via FTP, and running those files. 
It works in Windows when connected to the drone via WIFI.

_ The "FTPscripts" are part of the Scripts needed for the FTP transfer.

- The "FINAL" folder contains all the code related to the end result of my project - the localisation against Kinect application.
In there the jni folder contains work related to Winston's part - ask him if you are unsure about anything in there.
The 'main' file is the key program file that runs on the drone. I think it is fairly self-explanatory.

- The at_cmds needs to be updated to the latest SDK version from parrot, this may help with the issue where the hover mode goes crazy. 
Also use the Parrot code to access the sensor data (not done in my project).

- 'ardrone4' folder contains the most recent work done on replacing the firmware of the AR.Drone 2.0. To get this working you will 
need to get the video DSP to perform the optical flow stabilisation. The datasheet for the DSP is online. 
This code was adapted from 'dsk7' on github - check there for more up to date versions.

Any issues let me know.
